## Devlog
The way I would describe the relationship between these three is to make a comparison between these and creating and running a play. For this example components are the props and scripts, game objects are the actors, and scenes as scenes in a play. So before you perform a play the actors need to have their props and scripts. Props can be almost anything such as the tapestry, walls, objects, and outfits. These props give character to a play as they are what makes this play unique and colorful. Now scripts are what tell the actors and props what they can and can’t do. Such as there is a door that will never be opened because the script says that there is no reason to open it, the script also tells the actors what they can and can’t do in this environment. Such as where they can go and what they can interact with. Now with all the props and scripts given out the actors can begin their performance and perform the way the scripts allows them too and maybe there are a few adlibbing but it's all that happens when running a live performance. Without the props and scripts the actors would have no idea what to do, without the actors the set would be empty, and without all of these elements there would be no play. They rely on each other to create an interesting play that people want to watch.
